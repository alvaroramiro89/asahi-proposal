Hi team,

During the kick-off meeting, an idea was presented for you to work on: collaborative project proposals. 
As promised, hereby the details on what you should be preparing (all sales & marketing team members are requested to come up with a project proposal!) 

üéØ What Are We Looking For in Your Project Proposal?
We're inviting innovative, out-of-the-box collaborative projects that bring Sales & Marketing together in FY50.
Your idea does not have to be limited to your territory or field‚Äîwe encourage you to think cross-functional, cross-market, or even global!

‚úîÔ∏è Your Project Should:
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Be collaborative: Involve at least one fellow Sales colleague, plus team members from Marketing Communications and Product Management. Be clear on how each person contributes.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Be creative: We want new, bold, and fresh thinking.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Be actionable: Include an estimated budget and the resources needed to execute.

üìÖ Timeline: You Decide!
As part of your proposal, please include:
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†A suggested kick-off date
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Key milestones
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†When you expect to see initial results or impact
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†If applicable, any outcome or evaluation point
This helps us understand your project‚Äôs feasibility, pace, and ambition. Projects don‚Äôt need to be fully completed within FY50 but should show clear progress within the year. ( we have to make a project proposal and I have been ruminating over an idea) can you help me shape it? Our company currently is really big and has a great market share in the coronary field. But know we need to grow in the area of Vascular peripheral and Neurovascular. So I thought that maybe, in order to increase our market share we to step firmer on the education side. So I thought about participating more and be more present when physicians are a bit more advanced into the residency, by supporting them via knowledge and money. So i thought that way, by getting early into the physicians journey we can increase the amount of asahi users for NV and peripheral and protect the coronary field.
